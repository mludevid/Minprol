# MINPROL

Minprol (Minimalistic Programming Language) is an interpreted programming language with the goal of being as minimalistic as possible without losing any functionallity.
We'll see how that goes.

A documentation of the language is not planned until it has reached a more mature status.

At the moment it is a simple math expressions solver.
It can handle `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `()` for I32 (`1`), I64 (`1l`), F32 (`1.0`), F64 (`1.0d`), U32 (`1u`) and U64 (`1ul`) without mixing them.

To run it you'll need the Rust compiler. You can start the interpreter by running `cargo run`.
